# 21.The Temptation in the Wilderness: The True Meaning of Faith

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

After His baptism, Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, was led into the desolate wilderness. For forty days and forty nights, He fasted, a profound period of spiritual preparation that left Him physically famished. It was then, at His most vulnerable, that the Tempter, Satan himself, appeared.

The devil first challenged Jesus to turn stones into bread, preying on His gnawing hunger. But Jesus, unwavering, declared, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God." Next, Satan transported Him to the highest point of the temple, urging Him to throw Himself down, presuming God would send angels to save Him. Jesus retorted, "Do not put the Lord your God to the test." Finally, the devil offered Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory if Jesus would just bow down and worship him. With resolute authority, Jesus commanded, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.'"

Defeated, the devil departed, and angels came to minister to Jesus. This profound encounter revealed Jesus' absolute devotion and perfect obedience to God, demonstrating that true faith is not about miraculous displays or worldly power, but about unwavering trust in God's word and resisting every lure that seeks to divert us from His path. It affirmed His identity and set the stage for His ministry, showing that genuine strength lies in spiritual fortitude.
