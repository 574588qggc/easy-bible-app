## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

In the hushed glow of an upper room, on the eve of Passover, Jesus gathered his twelve disciples for a meal that would forever alter the course of history. This was no ordinary supper; it was a night steeped in destiny, a final, profound teaching before the ultimate sacrifice.

With a heavy heart, Jesus revealed that one among them would betray him, casting a shadow of disbelief and sorrow over the table. Yet, amidst this somber truth, He performed an act of unparalleled love and institution. Taking bread, He broke it, declaring it His body, broken for them. Then, lifting a cup of wine, He offered it as His blood, the new covenant poured out for the forgiveness of sins, commanding them to remember Him whenever they shared this sacred meal.

This solemn act was a testament to His impending sacrifice, a new covenant forged in love, promising eternal life and a spiritual communion with Him. It underscored themes of selfless service, profound love, and the enduring power of remembrance in the face of betrayal and death. The disciples, though bewildered, began to grasp the monumental significance of this farewell, understanding it as the foundation of their faith and the ultimate expression of divine love.

As the night deepened, the air thick with both sorrow and revelation, Jesus led them forth, towards Gethsemane and the trials that awaited. The Last Supper was not merely a meal; it was the birth of a sacrament, a testament to Christ's unwavering purpose, and a blueprint for hope and redemption, forever echoing through the ages.
