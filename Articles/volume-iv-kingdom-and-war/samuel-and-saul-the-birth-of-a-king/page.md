# 13.Samuel and Saul: The Birth of a King

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

When Israel clamored for a king, God, through His prophet Samuel, chose Saul, a towering and handsome man from the tribe of Benjamin. Saul, initially humble, was found while searching for his father's lost donkeys, secretly anointed by Samuel, and later publicly confirmed as Israel's first monarch. He proved a capable leader, uniting the tribes and achieving victories against their enemies.

However, Saul's reign was tragically marred by his growing disobedience to God's explicit commands. First, at Gilgal, impatient for Samuel's arrival, Saul presumptuously offered the burnt offering himself, usurping a priestly role. Samuel sternly rebuked him, declaring his kingdom would not endure. His second, more grievous transgression came during the war against the Amalekites. Despite God's command for total destruction, Saul spared King Agag and the best of the livestock, claiming it was for sacrifice. Samuel delivered God's unequivocal judgment: "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams." Because Saul rejected the word of the Lord, God rejected him as king.

This poignant tale underscores the critical importance of absolute obedience to divine authority over human reasoning or perceived piety. Saul's initial promise as a divinely appointed king withered under the weight of pride and disobedience, leading to his tragic downfall and paving the way for God to seek a new king, "a man after His own heart."
