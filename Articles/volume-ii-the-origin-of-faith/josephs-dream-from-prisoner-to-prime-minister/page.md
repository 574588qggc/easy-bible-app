# 8.Joseph’s Dream: From Prisoner to Prime Minister

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

Joseph, the favored son of Jacob, ignited his brothers' bitter jealousy with his prophetic dreams of their future subservience. Their envy culminated in a cruel betrayal: they sold him into slavery and deceived their father into believing he was dead.

Cast into Egypt, Joseph endured further injustice, falsely accused by Potiphar's wife and imprisoned. Yet, even in his darkest hour, God’s hand guided him. His unique gift for interpreting dreams eventually brought him before Pharaoh, who was troubled by cryptic visions. Joseph not only deciphered Pharaoh's dreams of seven years of abundance followed by seven years of devastating famine but also proposed a wise plan for Egypt's survival.

Recognizing God's wisdom in Joseph, Pharaoh elevated him from prisoner to Prime Minister, entrusting him with managing the entire land. Joseph diligently prepared Egypt, storing vast quantities of grain. When the famine gripped the world, his brothers, desperate for food, unknowingly journeyed to Egypt and bowed before him—fulfilling Joseph’s childhood dreams.

After testing their character, Joseph dramatically revealed his identity, offering profound forgiveness. He famously declared, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives." This powerful narrative showcases God's sovereign plan, transforming human malice into divine purpose, highlighting themes of faithfulness, forgiveness, and the ultimate triumph of good.
