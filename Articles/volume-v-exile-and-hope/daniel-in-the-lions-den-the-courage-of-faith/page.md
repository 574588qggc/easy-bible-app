# 17.Daniel in the Lions’ Den: The Courage of Faith

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

In ancient Babylon, Daniel, a man of profound wisdom and unwavering devotion to God, held a high and trusted position under King Darius. This stirred bitter jealousy among other officials, who plotted his downfall. They cunningly convinced the king to issue a decree: for thirty days, no one was to pray to any god or man except Darius himself, under penalty of being thrown into a den of lions.

Daniel, however, remained steadfast. Undeterred by the grave threat, he continued his daily prayers to God, three times a day, facing Jerusalem, just as he always had. His enemies swiftly reported his "crime" to the king. Though heartbroken and desperate to save Daniel, Darius was bound by his own unchangeable law. With a heavy heart, Daniel was cast into the fearsome lions’ den.

That night, King Darius was tormented, unable to sleep. At dawn, he rushed to the den, calling out to Daniel. Miraculously, Daniel replied! "My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths," he declared, "because I was found innocent in His sight." Overjoyed, the king commanded Daniel be lifted out, completely unharmed. His accusers, however, were thrown into the den and immediately devoured. King Darius then issued a new decree, proclaiming Daniel’s God as the living God, whose kingdom would never be destroyed. Daniel's story stands as a powerful testament to the courage of unwavering faith and divine protection in the face of persecution.
