# 18.Esther: The Hidden Queen

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

In the sprawling Persian Empire, King Xerxes, after deposing Queen Vashti, sought a new queen. A young Jewish orphan named Hadassah, known as Esther, was chosen, her true identity discreetly guarded by her wise cousin, Mordecai.

Soon, a sinister plot unfolded. Haman, the king's arrogant chief minister, infuriated by Mordecai’s refusal to bow, convinced Xerxes to issue a decree for the extermination of all Jews throughout the empire. Mordecai, heartbroken, implored Esther to intercede with the king, reminding her that perhaps she had been elevated to her royal position "for such a time as this."

Facing certain death if she approached the king unbidden, Esther bravely chose to act, first calling for a three-day fast. She then courageously invited the king and Haman to two banquets. At the second, she revealed her Jewish heritage and Haman’s wicked scheme to annihilate her people. Enraged, the king ordered Haman to be hanged on the very gallows he had prepared for Mordecai.

Through Esther's courage and divine providence, the decree was reversed, allowing the Jews to defend themselves and thwarting the genocide. Their deliverance is celebrated to this day as the festival of Purim. Esther's story is a powerful testament to the impact of one person's bravery, God's hidden hand guiding events, and the importance of standing up for justice, even in the face of overwhelming odds.
