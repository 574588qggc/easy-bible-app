# 5.The Tower of Babel: The Curse of Language

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

After the Great Flood, all humanity spoke a single language, a powerful bond uniting them. Gathered in the land of Shinar, they harbored a grand, audacious dream: to construct a city with a towering structure reaching into the heavens. Their motive wasn't merely architectural ambition, but a collective declaration of self-sufficiency and pride. "Let us make a name for ourselves," they declared, fearing dispersion and seeking glory apart from God.

From above, God observed their unified endeavor. He saw their incredible potential, yet also the dangerous trajectory of their collective hubris. If they could achieve this in defiance, what limits would they acknowledge? In a decisive act, God descended and confounded their speech. Suddenly, the builders, once a harmonious team, found themselves uttering incomprehensible sounds, their shared tongue fractured into a cacophony of foreign languages.

The grand project ground to a halt. Unable to communicate, collaboration became impossible. The once-united people dispersed across the face of the earth, divided by their newfound tongues, fulfilling God's original command to fill the earth, but in a way they hadn't intended. Thus, the city was named Babel, meaning "confusion," a lasting testament to humanity's pride and God's sovereign hand. It serves as a powerful reminder that unity against God's will leads not to glory, but to discord and dispersion, and that true progress lies in humility and obedience.
