# 2.Adam and Eve: The Forbidden Fruit and the Banishment

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

In the pristine Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve lived in perfect harmony, enjoying God's boundless grace. Their only restriction was not to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. A cunning serpent, however, tempted Eve, questioning God's word and promising god-like wisdom. Seduced by the serpent's lies and the fruit's allure, Eve ate, then offered it to Adam, who also partook.

Immediately, their eyes were opened, and they felt shame, realizing their nakedness. They tried to hide from God, but He called them forth. Instead of taking responsibility, Adam blamed Eve, and Eve blamed the serpent. For their profound disobedience, God pronounced curses: the serpent was condemned, Eve would experience pain in childbirth and be subject to her husband, and Adam would toil the ground for sustenance. Most tragically, they were banished from the idyllic Garden, lest they eat from the Tree of Life and live forever in their fallen state. This singular act of defiance introduced sin, suffering, and death into the world, demonstrating the profound consequences of choosing self-will over divine command and the irreversible loss of innocence that comes with it.
