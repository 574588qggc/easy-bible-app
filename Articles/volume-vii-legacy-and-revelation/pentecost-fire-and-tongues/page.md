# 25.Pentecost: Fire and Tongues

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

Fifty days after Jesus' resurrection, in the vibrant city of Jerusalem, the disciples gathered, faithfully awaiting the Holy Spirit promised by their ascended Lord. Suddenly, a sound like a violent, rushing wind filled the house where they sat, a divine roar that heralded a momentous arrival. Then, a breathtaking sight: individual tongues as of fire appeared and rested on each of them, illuminating their faces with an otherworldly glow.

Instantly, they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and an incredible transformation occurred. They began to speak in other languages, languages they had never learned, as the Spirit enabled them. Outside, a vast multitude of devout Jews from every corner of the Roman Empire had gathered for the festival. They were utterly bewildered, hearing these Galileans proclaiming the wonders of God in their own native tongues – Parthian, Mede, Elamite, and more!

Some mocked, accusing them of drunkenness, but Peter, empowered and bold, stood to declare the truth. He explained that this was the fulfillment of ancient prophecy, the promised outpouring of God's Spirit, testifying to Jesus Christ as Lord and Messiah. His words pierced their hearts, and that very day, thousands believed, were baptized, and joined the nascent church. Pentecost marked the explosive birth of the Church, demonstrating God's power to transcend linguistic and cultural barriers, equipping His followers with divine courage and ability to spread the Gospel to every nation.
