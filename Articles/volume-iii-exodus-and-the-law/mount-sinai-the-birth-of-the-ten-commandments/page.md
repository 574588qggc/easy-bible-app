# 11.Mount Sinai: The Birth of the Ten Commandments

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

After their miraculous liberation from Egyptian bondage, the newly freed Israelites journeyed through the vast wilderness, guided by God's pillar of cloud and fire. They arrived at the foot of Mount Sinai, a barren peak soon to become the stage for a profound divine encounter. The mountain thundered, lightning flashed, and thick smoke enveloped its summit, while a trumpet blast grew ever louder, signaling the very presence of the Almighty. The people trembled in awe and fear, witnessing an undeniable, terrifying manifestation of divine power.

Amidst this spectacular display, Moses, their chosen leader and intermediary, ascended the smoke-shrouded peak. There, God spoke directly to him, and through him, delivered to the entire nation a foundational moral and spiritual code: the Ten Commandments. Inscribed on two tablets of stone by the very finger of God, these commandments—prohibiting idolatry, murder, theft, and bearing false witness, while commanding honor for parents, reverence for God's name, and observing the Sabbath—formed the bedrock of their covenant with the Almighty. This moment marked not just the birth of a nation under divine law, but the establishment of a timeless ethical framework. It was a divine blueprint for righteous living, meant to guide humanity towards justice, holiness, and a proper relationship with both God and one another, underscoring the profound responsibility that came with being God's chosen people.
