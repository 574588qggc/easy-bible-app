# 1.Light and Chaos: The Seven Days of Creation

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

Before time began, a formless void stretched, shrouded in impenetrable darkness. Then, the Spirit of God hovered, and with a resounding command, "Let there be light!" — and light burst forth, banishing the chaos, separating day from night.

On the second day, a vast expanse was forged, dividing the waters above from the waters below, creating the sky. The third day saw dry land emerge from the seas, adorned with vibrant vegetation, each bearing seed according to its kind.

The heavens were then filled on the fourth day with luminous bodies: the sun to govern the day, the moon and stars to illuminate the night, marking seasons and times. The fifth day brought forth a teeming abundance of life in the waters and the air – magnificent sea creatures and birds soaring across the sky.

Finally, on the sixth day, the earth teemed with land animals, and in a breathtaking act of divine artistry, humanity was created in God’s own image, male and female, blessed with dominion over all creation.

Having brought perfect order and beauty from the void, God rested on the seventh day, hallowing it as a day of peace and reflection. This epic tale speaks of an omnipotent Creator, whose word brings existence from nothing, weaving purpose and intrinsic goodness into every fiber of the cosmos, establishing a divine order and humanity's sacred stewardship within it.
