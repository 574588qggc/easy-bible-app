# 10.The Ten Plagues and the Red Sea: The Price of Freedom

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

Pharaoh’s iron grip held the Israelites captive, their cries for freedom echoing through Egypt. God, hearing His people, sent Moses and Aaron to demand their release. But Pharaoh, proud and unyielding, repeatedly hardened his heart. Thus began a divine showdown: ten devastating plagues, each a testament to God's immense power and a direct challenge to Egypt's deities. From rivers turned to blood and swarms of frogs to boils, hail, and three days of suffocating darkness, Egypt suffered profoundly. The ultimate price came with the tenth plague – the death of every firstborn son, sparing only those Israelite homes marked by the Passover lamb.

Broken and terrified, Pharaoh finally capitulated, sending the Israelites away. But his resolve faltered quickly. He marshaled his chariots and pursued the fleeing multitude to the shores of the Red Sea, trapping them. With the Egyptian army closing in and the sea before them, despair loomed. Yet, God intervened. Moses stretched out his hand, and the waters miraculously parted, creating a dry path through the sea. The Israelites walked to freedom, but as Pharaoh's army charged into the chasm, the walls of water crashed down, engulfing them entirely. This epic escape underscored the profound cost of freedom and the boundless power of God to liberate His people, demonstrating that no human will, however mighty, can thwart divine purpose.
