# 7.Isaac and Jacob: Blessing and Deception

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

In his twilight years, Isaac, blind and frail, sought to bestow his sacred patriarchal blessing upon Esau, his robust, firstborn son and beloved hunter. He instructed Esau to hunt game and prepare a savory meal, after which he would impart the blessing. However, Rebekah, who favored their younger, more cunning son Jacob, overheard Isaac’s plan. Determined to secure the coveted blessing for Jacob, she swiftly orchestrated a daring deception.

Rebekah instructed Jacob to disguise himself, using goatskins to mimic Esau’s hairy arms and donning Esau’s clothes to carry his distinctive scent. Though hesitant, Jacob obeyed. He presented the prepared meal to his father, feigning Esau’s identity. Isaac, suspicious of the voice, was ultimately convinced by the feel of the "hairy" arms and the familiar scent of Esau’s garments. Believing he was blessing his firstborn, Isaac pronounced a powerful, irrevocable blessing upon Jacob—a blessing of dominion, prosperity, and preeminence over his brothers.

Moments later, Esau returned, only to discover the cruel betrayal. His anguish was profound, crying out in bitter grief for his lost birthright and blessing. The deception ignited a fierce hatred in Esau’s heart, forcing Jacob to flee for his life. This poignant narrative highlights the destructive power of favoritism and manipulation, demonstrating how human machinations, though seemingly successful, can lead to deep-seated family conflict and years of separation, underscoring the gravity of a blessing and the painful repercussions of deceit.
