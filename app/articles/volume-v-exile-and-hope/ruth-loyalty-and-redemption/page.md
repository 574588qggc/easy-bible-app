# 19.Ruth: Loyalty and Redemption

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

In a time of famine, Naomi, her husband Elimelech, and their two sons left Bethlehem for Moab. Tragedy soon struck: Elimelech died, and later, both sons died after marrying Moabite women, Orpah and Ruth. Left a widow with no children, Naomi decided to return to her homeland. She urged her daughters-in-law to stay, but while Orpah tearfully returned, Ruth famously declared her unwavering loyalty: "Where you go, I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God."

Arriving in Bethlehem impoverished, Ruth went to glean in the fields to provide for Naomi and herself. Providentially, she found herself in the field of Boaz, a wealthy and kind kinsman of Elimelech. Impressed by Ruth’s devotion to Naomi, Boaz showed her exceptional favor and protection. Naomi, recognizing Boaz as a potential kinsman-redeemer, instructed Ruth to approach him at the threshing floor.

Boaz, a man of integrity, agreed to redeem Ruth and the family land, but a closer relative had the first right. At the city gate, Boaz publicly presented the case. The closer relative declined, fearing it would harm his own inheritance. Boaz then joyfully fulfilled his role, marrying Ruth. Their union brought forth a son, Obed, who became the grandfather of King David, and thus an ancestor of Jesus Christ.

The story of Ruth beautifully illustrates steadfast loyalty (hesed), divine providence, and the power of redemption. It highlights how faithfulness, even in hardship, can lead to unexpected blessings and play a pivotal role in God's grand plan.
