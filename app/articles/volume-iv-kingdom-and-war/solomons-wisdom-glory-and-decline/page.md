# 15.Solomon’s Wisdom: Glory and Decline

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

Solomon, David’s son, ascended Israel’s throne and, when offered anything by God, humbly requested an understanding heart to govern his people. God, pleased with his selflessness, granted him unparalleled wisdom, riches, and honor. Solomon’s reign became a golden age: he judged with profound insight, composed thousands of proverbs, and oversaw the magnificent construction of the First Temple in Jerusalem, a testament to God’s glory. His fame spread far and wide, drawing dignitaries like the Queen of Sheba, who marveled at his splendor and sagacity, declaring that the half had not been told.

Yet, this era of unparalleled glory, born of divine wisdom, tragically paved the way for his decline. Despite God’s explicit commands against multiplying horses, silver, gold, and especially wives from foreign nations, Solomon amassed an enormous harem of 700 wives and 300 concubines. These foreign women, many from idolatrous cultures, gradually turned his heart away from the Lord in his old age. He built altars for their pagan gods, sacrificing to them and allowing their abominations to flourish within Israel.

God, angered by Solomon’s disobedience, declared that the kingdom would be torn from his son, leaving only a remnant for David’s sake. The wisest man on earth, blessed with divine insight, ultimately stumbled due to a lack of spiritual discipline and unwavering devotion. His story stands as a poignant reminder that even the greatest gifts and blessings can be squandered when worldly desires and compromise overshadow faithfulness to God, leading from unparalleled glory to a heartbreaking decline.
