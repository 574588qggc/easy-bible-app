# 27.The Vision of Revelation: A New Heaven and Earth

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

Amidst the tumultuous visions on the island of Patmos, the Apostle John witnessed a breathtaking culmination – the dawn of a New Heaven and a New Earth. The former things had passed away, and behold, God was making all things new. From the heavens descended the Holy City, New Jerusalem, radiant as a bride adorned for her husband. A great voice declared that God Himself would dwell with humanity, wiping every tear from their eyes. Death would be no more, neither sorrow nor crying, nor pain, for the former things had vanished.

This glorious city, built of precious stones with gates of pearl, needed no sun or moon, for the glory of God was its light, and the Lamb its lamp. From God's throne flowed a pure river of the water of life, clear as crystal, and on either side stood the Tree of Life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, its leaves for the healing of the nations. There would be no more curse, only the throne of God and the Lamb, and His servants would serve Him, seeing His face. This vision offers humanity the ultimate hope: a future of perfect fellowship with God, where all brokenness is healed, and eternal joy reigns supreme, a testament to God's unfailing love and ultimate victory over sin and death.
