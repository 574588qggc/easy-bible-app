# 6.The Calling of Abraham: Leaving Ur

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

Imagine a bustling, idolatrous city, Ur of the Chaldeans, where life was predictable, rooted in tradition and pagan worship. Here lived Abram, an ordinary man whose life was about to be profoundly interrupted by the extraordinary. One day, the voice of God pierced through the mundane, calling Abram to an unimaginable journey.

"Leave your country, your people, and your father’s household," God commanded, "and go to the land I will show you." This was no small request; it meant forsaking everything familiar for an unknown destination, a leap of faith into the void. Yet, alongside this audacious demand came a magnificent promise: God would make Abram into a great nation, bless him, make his name great, and through him, "all peoples on earth will be blessed."

At 75 years old, Abram didn't hesitate. He gathered his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all their possessions, leaving the security of Ur behind. His obedience was absolute, his trust unwavering, founded not on sight, but on the invisible promise of God. This monumental departure wasn't just a physical journey; it was the genesis of a divine covenant, a testament to faith's power to transcend comfort and logic, initiating a lineage that would ultimately bring blessing to the entire world. Abram's radical obedience laid the cornerstone for humanity's redemption story, proving that true faith means stepping out when God calls, even when the destination is unseen.
