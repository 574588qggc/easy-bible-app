# 9.The Calling of Moses: The Burning Bush

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

Far from the courts of Egypt he once knew, Moses, now a humble shepherd in Midian, stumbled upon an extraordinary sight on Mount Horeb: a bush engulfed in flames, yet miraculously unconsumed. From the heart of this supernatural fire, a voice called his name, commanding him to remove his sandals, for the ground he stood upon was holy.

It was God Himself, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, revealing His divine presence. He declared His profound empathy for the suffering Israelites enslaved in Egypt and unveiled His audacious plan: Moses, the very man who fled Pharaoh's wrath, was chosen to return and lead His people to freedom. Overwhelmed by fear and a profound sense of inadequacy, Moses questioned, "Who am I to go to Pharaoh?" and sought God's very name.

God responded with the powerful, self-existent declaration, "I AM WHO I AM," promising His unwavering presence and equipping Moses with miraculous signs – a staff that could transform into a serpent, and a hand that could become leprous and then healed – to convince both the Israelites and Pharaoh of his divine commission. Despite Moses's continued protests about his slow speech, God assured him that his brother Aaron would be his voice. This profound encounter transformed a fearful, self-doubting shepherd into the chosen instrument of God's mighty liberation, setting in motion the epic journey of the Exodus, demonstrating that God empowers the humble to accomplish the impossible.
