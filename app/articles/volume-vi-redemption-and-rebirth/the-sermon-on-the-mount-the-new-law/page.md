# 22.The Sermon on the Mount: The New Law

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

High upon a Galilean hillside, Jesus gathered His disciples and a vast crowd, His voice carrying a revolutionary message that would forever reshape humanity's understanding of God's law. He began with the Beatitudes, painting a portrait of true blessedness not in worldly power, but in humility, mercy, purity of heart, and a hunger for righteousness, promising the Kingdom of Heaven to these often overlooked souls.

He then declared His followers to be the "salt of the earth" and "light of the world," called to preserve goodness and illuminate truth. But the core of His sermon was a profound reinterpretation of the ancient Law. Jesus didn't abolish it; He fulfilled it, moving beyond mere outward compliance to the inner spirit. "You have heard it said, 'Do not murder,'" He taught, "but I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment." He extended this radical call to love, urging them to turn the other cheek, to go the extra mile, and most astonishingly, to "love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."

He taught them to give, pray, and fast in secret, seeking God's approval, not human praise. He warned against worry, urging them to "seek first His kingdom and His righteousness." The sermon culminated with a powerful call to action: not merely to hear His words, but to build one's life upon them, like a house built on solid rock, able to withstand any storm. This was the New Law – a law of radical love, internal transformation, and unwavering devotion to God's will.
