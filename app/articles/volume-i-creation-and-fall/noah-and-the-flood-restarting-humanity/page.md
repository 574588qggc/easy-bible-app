# 4.Noah and the Flood: Restarting Humanity

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

In a world consumed by pervasive wickedness and moral decay, where humanity’s every inclination was evil, God’s heart was deeply grieved. He resolved to cleanse the earth of its corruption, a profound act of divine judgment. Yet, one man, Noah, found favor in His eyes, for he was righteous and walked faithfully with God amidst the prevailing depravity.

God commanded Noah to build a colossal ark, a vessel unlike any other, providing precise instructions for its construction. He was to gather his family and pairs of every living creature, preserving them from the impending catastrophe. Despite the mockery and disbelief of a cynical world, Noah obeyed, driven by unwavering faith and trust in God's word.

For forty days and nights, the heavens opened, unleashing a devastating deluge that submerged the entire earth, eradicating all life outside the ark. The ark, a beacon of hope and a testament to God's preservation, floated above the tumultuous waters, carrying the seeds of a new beginning.

As the waters receded, Noah, his family, and the animals finally emerged onto a cleansed, reborn world. In an act of profound worship and gratitude, Noah built an altar, offering sacrifices to the Lord. Pleased, God established a solemn covenant, promising never again to destroy all life by flood. The vibrant rainbow became the eternal, majestic symbol of this divine promise – a powerful testament to God's justice, His profound mercy, and the enduring hope of a fresh start for humanity, rooted in obedience, faith, and divine grace.
