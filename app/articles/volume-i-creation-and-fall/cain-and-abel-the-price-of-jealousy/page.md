# 3.Cain and Abel: The Price of Jealousy

## 故事编号


## 故事摘要

Born of Adam and Eve, Cain, a diligent farmer, and Abel, a humble shepherd, each brought an offering before the Lord. Cain presented fruits of the soil, while Abel, with a pure heart, offered the choicest firstborn of his flock. God looked with favor upon Abel and his offering, but not on Cain's. A searing jealousy ignited in Cain's heart, twisting his features with anger and dejection.

God, seeing the darkness brewing, warned Cain: "If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it." Yet, Cain succumbed to his bitterness. He lured his unsuspecting brother, Abel, into a field and, consumed by envy, brutally murdered him.

When God questioned Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" Cain defiantly retorted, "Am I my brother's keeper?" The ground itself cried out, having swallowed Abel's innocent blood. For his heinous act, Cain was cursed: the earth would no longer yield its bounty for him, and he would become a restless wanderer, forever marked by his sin. Banished from God's presence, Cain bore the heavy burden of his jealousy, a chilling testament to how envy, left unchecked, can lead to the most devastating of prices.
