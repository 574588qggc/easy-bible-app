# Noah's Ark

## The Great Flood

The Lord saw that the wickedness of mankind was great on the earth, and He decided to send a flood to destroy all life.

### God's Command to Noah

But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord. God said to Noah, "I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens. But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you."

### Building the Ark

God commanded Noah to build an ark of cypress wood, 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. Noah was to bring two of every kind of animal into the ark to keep them alive during the flood.

### The Flood

Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came on the earth. All the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered, and every living thing that moved on land perished.

### The Dove and the Olive Branch

After 150 days, the water receded. Noah sent out a dove to see if the water had dried up from the surface of the ground. The dove returned with a freshly plucked olive leaf in its beak, showing that vegetation was growing again.

### The Covenant

When Noah came out of the ark, God blessed him and said, "I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you. Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood."
