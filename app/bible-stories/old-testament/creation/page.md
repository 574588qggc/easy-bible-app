# Creation Story

## The Beginning

In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters.

### Day 1: Light
God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. God saw that the light was good and separated the light from the darkness.

### Day 2: Sky and Water
God said, "Let there be a sky in the middle of the waters," and it was so. He called the sky "heaven."

### Day 3: Land and Plants
God said, "Let the waters below the sky be gathered into one place so that the dry ground may appear," and it was so. Then God said, "Let the earth produce vegetation."

### Day 4: Sun, Moon, and Stars
God said, "Let lights appear in the sky to separate the day from the night," and it was so.

### Day 5: Sea Creatures and Birds
God said, "Let the waters be filled with fish and other life, and let birds fly above the earth," and it was so.

### Day 6: Land Animals and Humans
God said, "Let the earth produce every sort of animal," and it was so. Then God said, "Let us make human beings in our image, to be like us."

### Day 7: Rest
On the seventh day, God rested from all his work and declared it holy.
