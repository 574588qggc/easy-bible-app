# Moses and the Law

## The Lawgiver

Moses is the central figure of the Torah and the leader who brought the Israelites out of Egypt.

### The Burning Bush

Moses was tending his father-in-law's flock when he saw a bush that was on fire but not being consumed. God spoke to him from the bush, saying, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt."

### The Ten Plagues

God sent Moses to Pharaoh to demand the release of the Israelites. When Pharaoh refused, God sent ten plagues upon Egypt: water turning to blood, frogs, gnats, flies, livestock disease, boils, hail, locusts, darkness, and the death of the firstborn.

### The Exodus

After the tenth plague, Pharaoh finally let the Israelites go. Moses led them out of Egypt, and God parted the Red Sea so they could cross on dry ground. When Pharaoh's army pursued them, the sea closed in and drowned them.

### The Ten Commandments

At Mount Sinai, God gave Moses the Ten Commandments written on two stone tablets. These commandments became the foundation of God's law and the moral code for the Israelites.

### The Promised Land

After forty years of wandering in the wilderness, Moses led the Israelites to the edge of the Promised Land. Though Moses did not enter the land himself, he saw it from a distance before his death.
