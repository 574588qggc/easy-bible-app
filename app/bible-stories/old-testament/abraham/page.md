# Abraham's Journey

## The Father of Faith

Abraham is known as the father of faith and the founder of the Hebrew nation.

### The Call of God

God said to Abram, "Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you."

### The Promise

God made a covenant with Abraham, promising that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Though Abraham was old and his wife Sarah was barren, God promised them a son.

### The Test of Faith

God tested Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice his only son, Isaac. Abraham obeyed and took Isaac to the mountain. But as Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac, an angel stopped him, saying, "Do not lay a hand on the boy. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son."

### The Legacy

Abraham's faith and obedience made him a model for believers throughout history. His descendants became the nation of Israel, and through him, God's promise of salvation came to all nations.
