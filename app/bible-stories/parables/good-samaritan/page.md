# The Good Samaritan

## A Lesson in Compassion

Jesus told this parable to teach about loving your neighbor and showing mercy to those in need.

### The Question

A lawyer asked Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?" Jesus responded with a parable.

### The Priest and the Levite

A man was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him, and left him half dead on the road.

A priest came down the same road, but when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. Similarly, a Levite came to the place, looked at the man, and passed by on the other side.

### The Samaritan

Then a Samaritan came along. When he saw the man, he took pity on him. He went to him, bandaged his wounds, and poured oil and wine on them. He put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

### The Lesson

Jesus asked the lawyer, "Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?" The lawyer replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus said, "Go and do likewise."

### The Message

The parable teaches that true neighborliness transcends social, ethnic, and religious boundaries. We are called to show compassion and mercy to all people in need.
