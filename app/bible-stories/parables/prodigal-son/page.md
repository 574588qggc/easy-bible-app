# The Prodigal Son

## A Story of Forgiveness

Jesus told this parable to illustrate God's love and forgiveness.

### The Younger Son Leaves

A man had two sons. The younger son asked his father for his share of the inheritance early. The father divided his property between them, and the younger son set off for a distant country.

### Squandering the Wealth

There, the younger son squandered all his wealth in wild living. When a severe famine struck the land, he found himself in need. He took a job feeding pigs, and he longed to eat the food the pigs were eating.

### Coming to His Senses

Finally, he came to his senses and said, "How many of my father's hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father."

### The Father's Welcome

While the son was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. The son said, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son."

### The Celebration

But the father said to his servants, "Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found."
