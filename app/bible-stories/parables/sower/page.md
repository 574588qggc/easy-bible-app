# The Sower

## A Parable About Receptiveness

Jesus told this parable to explain why people respond differently to his message.

### The Sowing

A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.

### The Four Types of Soil

Some seed fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, but when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.

Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.

Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew, and produced a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown.

### The Explanation

Jesus explained that the seed represents God's word. The path represents those who hear the word but do not understand it. The rocky places represent those who receive the word with joy but have no root and fall away when trouble comes.

The thorns represent those who hear the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.

The good soil represents those who hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop.

### The Message

The parable teaches that God's word is sown generously, but its effectiveness depends on how people receive it and respond to it.
