# Walking on Water

## A Demonstration of Divine Power

Jesus walked on water to demonstrate his power over nature and to teach his disciples about faith.

### The Storm

The disciples were in a boat on the sea, and a strong wind was blowing. The waves were crashing against the boat, and the disciples were struggling to row.

### Jesus Appears

During the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came toward them, walking on the water. When the disciples saw him, they were terrified. They thought he was a ghost.

### Do Not Be Afraid

Jesus said to them, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid." Peter said, "Lord, if it's you, tell me to come to you on the water."

Jesus said, "Come." Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.

### The Test of Faith

But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!" Immediately, Jesus reached out and caught him. He said, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"

### The Calm

When Jesus got into the boat, the wind died down. The disciples in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."

### The Message

This miracle teaches that faith in Jesus can sustain us even in the midst of life's storms.
