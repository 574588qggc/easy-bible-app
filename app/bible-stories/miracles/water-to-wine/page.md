# Water to Wine

## The First Miracle

Jesus performed his first miracle at a wedding in Cana of Galilee.

### The Wedding Feast

Jesus and his disciples had been invited to a wedding. Jesus's mother Mary was also there. When the wine ran out, Mary said to Jesus, "They have no more wine."

### Jesus's Response

Jesus replied, "Woman, why do you involve me? My hour has not yet come." But Mary told the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."

### The Miracle

Nearby stood six stone water jars, each holding about thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water." So they filled them to the brim. Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet."

### The Master's Amazement

The master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. He called the bridegroom aside and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."

### The Significance

This was the first of the signs through which Jesus revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.
