# Feeding the Five Thousand

## A Miracle of Abundance

Jesus performed this miracle to feed a large crowd that had gathered to hear him teach.

### The Gathering

A large crowd of about five thousand people had gathered to hear Jesus teach. It was getting late, and the people were hungry.

### The Problem

The disciples said to Jesus, "This is a remote place, and it's already very late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food."

Jesus replied, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."

### The Resources

The disciples said, "We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish." Jesus said, "Bring them here to me."

### The Miracle

Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish and, looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.

They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.

### The Significance

This miracle demonstrated Jesus's power to provide for people's physical needs. It also foreshadowed the Eucharist, in which Jesus's body and blood are symbolically shared with believers.
