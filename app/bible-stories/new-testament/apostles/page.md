# The Apostles

## Jesus's Chosen Disciples

The apostles were the twelve men chosen by Jesus to be his closest followers and to spread his message after his resurrection.

### Peter

Peter was a fisherman and one of Jesus's first disciples. Jesus said to him, "You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church." Peter became a leader of the early church and was eventually martyred in Rome.

### James and John

James and John were brothers, sons of Zebedee. They were fishermen and were called "Sons of Thunder" by Jesus. James was the first apostle to be martyred, and John became a leader of the church in Jerusalem.

### Andrew

Andrew was Peter's brother and was the first to follow Jesus. He brought Peter to Jesus and later brought the boy with the loaves and fishes to Jesus.

### Philip and Bartholomew

Philip was from Bethsaida and brought Nathanael (Bartholomew) to Jesus. Bartholomew is believed to have been martyred in Armenia.

### Matthew

Matthew was a tax collector before Jesus called him to be an apostle. He wrote the Gospel of Matthew and is believed to have been martyred in Ethiopia.

### Thomas

Thomas is known as "Doubting Thomas" because he doubted Jesus's resurrection until he saw Jesus himself. He later became a missionary and is believed to have traveled to India.

### The Other Apostles

The remaining apostles were James the Less, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot. After Judas's betrayal and death, Matthias was chosen to replace him.

### Their Legacy

The apostles spread the gospel throughout the world, established churches, and many were martyred for their faith. Their writings and teachings form the foundation of the New Testament.
