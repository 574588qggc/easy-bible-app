# Jesus's Ministry

## Teaching and Healing

Jesus's ministry lasted approximately three years and was marked by teaching, healing, and miracles.

### The Baptism

Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. As Jesus came up out of the water, the Spirit of God descended on him like a dove, and a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."

### The Twelve Apostles

Jesus called twelve apostles to be his closest followers: Peter, Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the Less, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.

### The Sermon on the Mount

Jesus taught his followers the Beatitudes and the core principles of his kingdom. He taught them to love their enemies, to pray in secret, and to seek first the kingdom of God.

### Miracles and Healings

Jesus performed many miracles: he healed the sick, cast out demons, calmed storms, and raised the dead. These miracles demonstrated his power and compassion.

### The Message of Salvation

Jesus taught that he came to seek and save the lost, and that whoever believes in him will have eternal life. He emphasized the importance of repentance, faith, and love for God and neighbor.
