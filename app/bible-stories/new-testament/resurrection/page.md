# Resurrection

## The Victory Over Death

The resurrection of Jesus is the central event of Christianity and the foundation of Christian faith.

### The Crucifixion

Jesus was arrested, tried, and condemned to death by crucifixion. He was crucified on a hill called Golgotha, between two criminals. As he died, he said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit."

### The Burial

After Jesus died, a man named Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the Sanhedrin, asked Pilate for Jesus's body. He wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and placed it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock.

### The Resurrection

On the third day, Jesus rose from the dead. The women who went to the tomb found it empty. An angel told them, "He is not here; he has risen, just as he said."

### The Appearances

After his resurrection, Jesus appeared to his disciples and many others over a period of forty days. He ate with them, taught them, and commissioned them to go and make disciples of all nations.

### The Ascension

Forty days after his resurrection, Jesus was taken up into heaven in the presence of his disciples. He promised them that he would send the Holy Spirit to empower them to be his witnesses.

### The Hope of Resurrection

Through Jesus's resurrection, believers have the hope of eternal life and the promise that death has been defeated.
