# Birth of Jesus

## The Nativity

Jesus was born in Bethlehem during the reign of King Herod. His mother Mary was a virgin, and she conceived by the Holy Spirit.

### The Journey to Bethlehem

Mary and Joseph traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem to register for the census. When they arrived, there was no room at the inn, so Jesus was born in a stable and laid in a manger.

### The Shepherds

That night, shepherds were watching their flocks in the fields. An angel appeared to them and said, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you."

### The Wise Men

Wise men from the east saw a star and traveled to Jerusalem, asking, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews?" They followed the star to Bethlehem and found Jesus. They bowed down and worshiped him, presenting him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

### The Flight to Egypt

An angel warned Joseph in a dream that King Herod was looking for the child to kill him. Joseph took Mary and Jesus and fled to Egypt, where they stayed until Herod died.
